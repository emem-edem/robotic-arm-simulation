# Robotic Arm Simulation

## Introductions
Welcome to my Robotic Arm Simulation project! This project simulates the behavior of a robotic arm using Panda-Gym and training robots using stable-Baseline algorithms. It's designed for educational purposes and showcases my interest in robotics and automation. After this I would push the trained agent and the code to the Hub with a nice video replay and an evaluation score. 

## Features
Realistic robotic arm simulation
Multiple control algorithms (e.g., PID, machine learning-based control)
Interactive GUI for easy manipulation and visualization
Modular codebase for easy customization and extension


## Motivation
I created this project to deepen my understanding of robotics and control systems. Through this simulation, I aimed to explore different control strategies and their impact on the performance of a robotic arm.
